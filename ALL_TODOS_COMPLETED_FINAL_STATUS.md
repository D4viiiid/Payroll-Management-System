## 🛠️ ISSUES FIXED DURING VERIFICATION

### Issue #1: Payroll Records Showing "Unknown" Employees ✅ FIXED
- **Root Cause:** Missing employee ObjectId reference + no population
- **Solution:** 
  - Updated Payroll schema with employee field
  - Added population to GET routes
  - Migrated existing 4 records
- **Result:** All payroll records now show correct employee names

### Issue #2: Missing paymentStatus Field ✅ FIXED

- **Solution:** Added enum field (Pending/Paid/Processing) with default 'Pending'
- **Result:** Payment status now trackable and displayable

### Issue #3: Fingerprint Template Format Mismatch ✅ FIXED
- **Root Cause:** Legacy single field vs new array format
- **Solution:** 
  - Created migration script
  - Migrated 11 employees with legacy data
  - Fixed 8 employees with incorrect status
- **Result:** All 11 enrolled employees now show 1 fingerprint each

### Issue #4: Schema-Reality Mismatch ✅ FIXED
- **Root Cause:** Schema had 5 fields, database had 12
- **Solution:** Expanded schema to include all fields
- **Result:** Schema now matches actual database structure
