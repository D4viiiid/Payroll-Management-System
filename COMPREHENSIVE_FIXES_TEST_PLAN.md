# Comprehensive Fixes Test Plan
## October 17, 2025

### Issues Fixed in This Session

---

## ✅ Issue #1: Profile Picture Persistence
**Problem:** Profile picture disappears after logout/login  
**Root Cause:** Backend GET `/employees/:id` endpoint was not selecting the `profilePicture` field  
**Fix Applied:** Modified `Employee.js` line 268 to add `+profilePicture` to `.select()` call

### Test Steps:
1. Login as an employee
2. Navigate to profile
3. Upload a new profile picture
4. Wait for success notification
5. Logout
6. Login again
7. **VERIFY:** Profile picture should persist and display correctly

**Expected Result:** Profile picture shows up after re-login  
**Files Modified:** `employee/payroll-backend/routes/Employee.js`

---

## ✅ Issue #2: Overtime Pay Cap Logic
**Problem:** Overtime pay was given even for auto-timeout (should only apply for manual timeout after 5 PM)  
**Root Cause:** Logic didn't distinguish between auto-closed shifts and manual timeouts  
**Fix Applied:** Modified `attendanceCalculator.js` to check:
- `wasAutoClosed` (from notes field containing "[Auto-closed")
- `isAfter5PM` (timeout >= 17:00 / 5:00 PM)
- NOT Full Day employee (capped at ₱550)

### Test Steps:

#### Test 2A: Auto-Timeout (NO overtime pay)
1. Employee times in at 8:00 AM
2. Forgets to time out
3. System auto-closes after 12 hours (8:00 PM)
4. **VERIFY:** Overtime hours tracked BUT `overtimePay = 0`
5. **VERIFY:** Notes show "Auto-closed after X hrs. No overtime pay for automatic timeout"

#### Test 2B: Manual Timeout After 5 PM (WITH overtime pay)
1. Employee times in at 8:00 AM
2. Employee manually times out at 6:00 PM (18:00) via fingerprint
3. **VERIFY:** 2 hours overtime calculated
4. **VERIFY:** `overtimePay = 2 × ₱85.94 = ₱171.88`
5. **VERIFY:** Notes show "Manual timeout after 5 PM: 2.00hrs × ₱85.94 = ₱171.88"

#### Test 2C: Manual Timeout Before 5 PM (NO overtime pay)
1. Employee times in at 8:00 AM
2. Employee manually times out at 4:30 PM (16:30) via fingerprint
3. **VERIFY:** 0 overtime hours
4. **VERIFY:** `overtimePay = 0`
5. **VERIFY:** dayType = "Half Day" (less than 8 hours)

#### Test 2D: Full Day Employee (NO overtime pay)
1. Full Day employee times in at 8:00 AM
2. Full Day employee manually times out at 7:00 PM (19:00)
3. **VERIFY:** 3 hours overtime tracked BUT `overtimePay = 0`
4. **VERIFY:** Total pay capped at ₱550 (dailyRate)
5. **VERIFY:** Notes show "Worked 3.00hrs overtime but no extra pay for Full Day rate (₱550 max)"

**Expected Results:** 
- Auto-timeout: NO overtime pay
- Manual timeout after 5 PM: Overtime pay calculated
- Manual timeout before 5 PM: NO overtime pay
- Full Day employees: NO overtime pay ever

**Files Modified:** `employee/payroll-backend/utils/attendanceCalculator.js`

## ⚠️ Issue #3: Hire Date Validation
**Problem:** EMP-9080 has Oct 15, 2025 attendance but Oct 16, 2025 hire date  
**Root Cause:** PENDING INVESTIGATION - validation code exists at `attendance.js:395-410`  
**Status:** Need to verify actual hire date in database vs screenshot

### Test Steps:
1. Query database for EMP-9080:
   ```javascript
   const emp = await Employee.findOne({ employeeId: 'EMP-9080' });
   console.log('Hire Date:', emp.hireDate);
   
   const att = await Attendance.find({ employeeId: 'EMP-9080' }).sort({ date: 1 });
   console.log('Earliest Attendance:', att[0].date);
   ```
2. Verify hire date is Oct 16, 2025
3. Verify attendance exists for Oct 15, 2025
4. If YES, check if record was created before validation was added
5. Option A: Delete pre-hire attendance records
6. Option B: Update employee hire date to Oct 15, 2025

**Expected Result:** No attendance records should exist before hire date  
**Files Modified:** None (validation already exists)  
**Action Required:** Database cleanup or data correction

---

## ⚠️ Issue #4: Dashboard Statistics Accuracy
**Problem:** User reports 4 full-day (should be 2), 5 absent (should be 8)  
**Root Cause:** RESOLVED - Actual data shows:
- 2 Full Day (EMP-1491, EMP-2651) ✅ 
- 1 Half Day (EMP-1480)
- 7 Absent (10 total - 3 attended) ✅

**Database Query Result:**
```
Oct 17, 2025:
- EMP-1480: Half Day (09:31 - 17:00)
- EMP-1491: Full Day (08:00 - 17:00)
- EMP-2651: Full Day (08:00 - 18:00)

Stats: 2 Full Day, 1 Half Day, 7 Absent
Math: 0 Present + 2 Full + 1 Half + 7 Absent = 10 Total ✅
```

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Check current date displayed
3. **VERIFY:** Stats match:
   - Total Present: 0
   - Full Day: 2
   - Half Day: 1
   - Absent: 7
4. If numbers don't match, check if browser cache is stale
5. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear localStorage

**Expected Result:** Dashboard shows correct statistics for today  
**Files Modified:** None (stats calculation already correct)  
**Action Required:** Frontend cache clear / verify correct date

## ❌ Issue #5: Salary Page Implementation
**Problem:** Filters not working, status showing wrong values  
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Required Changes:**
1. Today filter - show today's salary records
2. Week filter - default to current week (Week 42 for Oct 17)
3. Month filter - default to current month (October 2025)
4. Year filter - default to current year (2025)
5. Status field - show `dayType` from attendance (half-day/full-day) instead of employee type (Regular/On-Call)

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to Salary page
2. Click "Today" filter
3. **VERIFY:** Shows only today's salary records
4. Click "Week" filter
5. **VERIFY:** Defaults to Week 42, shows current week's records
6. Click "Month" filter
7. **VERIFY:** Defaults to October, shows October's records
8. **VERIFY:** Status column shows "Full Day" or "Half Day" (not "Regular")

**Expected Result:** All filters work with proper defaults, status shows attendance dayType  
**Files Modified:** PENDING - `employee/src/components/Salary.jsx`
