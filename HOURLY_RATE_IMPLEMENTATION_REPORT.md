# Hourly Rate Implementation Report
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**System:** Payroll Management System - Rae Disenyo Garden and Landscaping Services  
**Implementation:** Half-Day + Hourly Rate Calculation for Partial Work Hours

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a new salary calculation logic that provides fair compensation for employees who:
- Time-in after 9:30 AM (Half-Day status)
- Work more than 4 hours but less than 8 hours
- Time-out before 5:00 PM

**Key Achievement:** Employees now receive **half-day base pay (₱275) + hourly rate (₱68.75/hr)** for additional hours worked beyond the 4-hour minimum.

---

## 🎯 Business Requirement

### Original Request
> "Add new calculation of the salary computation if the employee time in at 9:31am and then for example time out at exactly 3:31pm (5hrs) the attendance tracking status color must be still half-day but the computation of the salary must be half-day + hourly rate (275+68.75)."

### Interpretation
- **Scenario:** Employee arrives after 9:30 AM (late) and works 4-8 hours
- **Status Display:** Should remain "Half-day" (yellow badge) for consistency
- **Salary Calculation:** Should be enhanced to include hourly compensation
- **Formula:** Base Half-Day (₱275) + (Extra Hours × Hourly Rate ₱68.75)

---

## 💰 Salary Calculation Logic

### Rate Structure
| Rate Type | Amount | Calculation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Daily Rate** | ₱550 | Full day standard |
| **Hourly Rate** | ₱68.75 | ₱550 ÷ 8 hours |
| **Half-Day Base** | ₱275 | ₱550 ÷ 2 |
| **Overtime Rate** | ₱85.94 | Premium rate for hours > 8 |

### New Calculation Rules

#### **Rule 1: Time-In Before 9:30 AM → Full Day**
- **Eligibility:** Arrived by 9:30 AM
- **Salary:** ₱550 (full daily rate)
- **No matter hours worked:** Full-day credit

#### **Rule 2: Time-In After 9:30 AM + Work < 4 Hours → Incomplete**
- **Eligibility:** Late arrival + insufficient hours
- **Salary:** ₱0 (no pay for incomplete day)
- **Reason:** Did not meet minimum 4-hour threshold

#### **Rule 3: Time-In After 9:30 AM + Work Exactly 4 Hours → Half-Day**
- **Eligibility:** Late arrival + minimum 4 hours worked
- **Salary:** ₱275 (half-day base only)
- **Example:** 9:31 AM - 2:32 PM (4.02 hours after lunch) = ₱276.37

#### **Rule 4: Time-In After 9:30 AM + Work 4-8 Hours → Half-Day + Hourly** ⭐ NEW
- **Eligibility:** Late arrival + more than 4 hours but less than 8 hours
- **Salary Formula:**
  ```
  Salary = ₱275 + ((Hours Worked - 4) × ₱68.75)
  ```
- **Examples:**
  - **5 hours:** ₱275 + (1 × ₱68.75) = **₱343.75**
  - **5.25 hours:** ₱275 + (1.25 × ₱68.75) = **₱360.94**
  - **5.5 hours:** ₱275 + (1.5 × ₱68.75) = **₱378.13**
  - **6 hours:** ₱275 + (2 × ₱68.75) = **₱412.50**
  - **7 hours:** ₱275 + (3 × ₱68.75) = **₱481.25**

#### **Rule 5: Time-In After 9:30 AM + Work 8+ Hours → Full Day**
- **Eligibility:** Late arrival but worked full 8 hours or more
- **Salary:** ₱550 + overtime pay for hours > 8
- **Note:** Rare scenario but theoretically possible

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Modified File: `attendanceCalculator.js`

#### Location
`employee/payroll-backend/utils/attendanceCalculator.js`

#### Changes Made

**1. Updated `calculateDaySalary` Function**

**Before:**
```javascript
const calculateDaySalary = (dayType, dailyRate) => {
  switch (dayType) {
    case 'Full Day':
      return dailyRate;
    case 'Half Day':
      return dailyRate * 0.5; // Always ₱275
    case 'Incomplete':
    case 'Absent':
    default:
      return 0;
  }
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const calculateDaySalary = (dayType, dailyRate, hoursWorked = 0) => {
  const hourlyRate = dailyRate / 8; // ₱550 / 8 = ₱68.75 per hour
  const halfDayBase = dailyRate * 0.5; // ₱275
  
  switch (dayType) {
    case 'Full Day':
      return dailyRate;
    case 'Half Day':
      // NEW LOGIC: If worked more than 4 hours but less than 8 hours
      if (hoursWorked > HALF_DAY_MINIMUM_HOURS && hoursWorked < FULL_DAY_HOURS) {
        // Half-day base + hourly rate for additional hours beyond 4
        const extraHours = hoursWorked - HALF_DAY_MINIMUM_HOURS;
        const additionalPay = extraHours * hourlyRate;
        return halfDayBase + additionalPay;
      }
      // Standard half-day (exactly 4 hours or defaulting to half-day rate)
      return halfDayBase;
    case 'Incomplete':
    case 'Absent':
    default:
      return 0;
  }
};
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added `hoursWorked` parameter
- ✅ Calculated hourly rate (₱68.75)
- ✅ Added conditional logic for 4-8 hour range
- ✅ Calculated extra hours beyond 4-hour minimum
- ✅ Applied hourly rate to extra hours

**2. Updated `validateAndCalculateAttendance` Function**

**Before:**
```javascript
const daySalary = calculateDaySalary(dayTypeResult.dayType, dailyRate);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const hoursWorkedNum = parseFloat(dayTypeResult.hoursWorked) || 0;
const daySalary = calculateDaySalary(dayTypeResult.dayType, dailyRate, hoursWorkedNum);
```

**Added to Return Object:**
```javascript
return {
  ...dayTypeResult,
  overtimeHours: overtimeHours.toFixed(2),
  overtimePay: overtimePay.toFixed(2),
  daySalary: daySalary.toFixed(2),
  totalPay: (parseFloat(daySalary) + parseFloat(overtimePay)).toFixed(2),
  dailyRate,
  overtimeRate,
  hourlyRate: (dailyRate / 8).toFixed(2), // ⭐ NEW: Added for transparency
  calculatedAt: new Date()
};
```

Time-Out:     3:31 PM
Total Time:   6 hours
Lunch Break:  -1 hour (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)
Hours Worked: 5 hours

Calculation:
  Half-Day Base:     ₱275.00
  Extra Hours:       5 - 4 = 1 hour
  Hourly Rate:       ₱68.75
  Additional Pay:    1 × ₱68.75 = ₱68.75
  Total Salary:      ₱275.00 + ₱68.75 = ₱343.75 ✅
```

#### Example 2: 9:45 AM - 4:00 PM (5.25 hours)
```
Time-In:      9:45 AM
Time-Out:     4:00 PM
Total Time:   6.25 hours
Lunch Break:  -1 hour
Hours Worked: 5.25 hours

Calculation:
  Half-Day Base:     ₱275.00
  Extra Hours:       5.25 - 4 = 1.25 hours
  Hourly Rate:       ₱68.75
  Additional Pay:    1.25 × ₱68.75 = ₱85.94
  Total Salary:      ₱275.00 + ₱85.94 = ₱360.94 ✅
```

#### Example 3: 10:00 AM - 4:30 PM (5.5 hours)

Time-In:      10:00 AM
Time-Out:     4:30 PM
Total Time:   6.5 hours
Lunch Break:  -1 hour
Hours Worked: 5.5 hours

Calculation:
  Half-Day Base:     ₱275.00
  Extra Hours:       5.5 - 4 = 1.5 hours
  Hourly Rate:       ₱68.75
  Additional Pay:    1.5 × ₱68.75 = ₱103.13
  Total Salary:      ₱275.00 + ₱103.13 = ₱378.13 ✅

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Attendance Recording → Salary Calculation

```
1. Employee scans fingerprint (Time-In: 9:31 AM)
   ↓
2. System records timeIn in Attendance collection
   ↓
3. Employee scans fingerprint again (Time-Out: 3:31 PM)
   ↓
4. System calculates:
   - Hours worked: 5 hours (6 hours - 1 hour lunch)
   - Day Type: "Half Day" (timeIn > 9:30 AM)
   - Status calculation triggered
   ↓
5. attendanceCalculator.js processes:
   - determineTimeInStatus() → "Half Day"
   - calculateHoursWorked() → 5.00 hours
   - calculateDaySalary() → ₱343.75
     * Base: ₱275
     * Extra: 1 hour × ₱68.75 = ₱68.75
   ↓
6. Attendance record updated with:
   - dayType: "Half Day"
   - actualHoursWorked: 5.00
   - daySalary: 343.75
   - totalPay: 343.75
   - hourlyRate: 68.75
   ↓
7. Weekly payroll generation (Sunday 11:59 PM):
   - Aggregates all attendance records
   - Calculates basicSalary (sum of daySalary fields)
   - Creates EnhancedPayroll record
   ↓
8. Payslip display:
   - Shows "Half-day" status (yellow badge)
   - Displays ₱343.75 in salary breakdown
   - Payslip generation includes hourly rate detail
```

---

## 🎓 User Training Notes

### For HR/Admin
1. **No manual intervention needed** - system calculates automatically
2. **Verify payroll** - check half-day records show enhanced pay
3. **Review payslips** - ensure hourly rate appears in breakdown
4. **Monitor exceptions** - incomplete days (<4 hours) still get ₱0

### For Employees
1. **Scan once for Time-In** - after 9:30 AM = Half-day status
2. **Work at least 4 hours** - to receive half-day pay
3. **Every extra hour counts** - ₱68.75 added per hour beyond 4
4. **Check payslip** - salary breakdown shows half-day + hourly
5. **Example:** 
   - Arrive 9:45 AM, leave 4:00 PM = 5.25 hours
   - Salary: ₱275 + (1.25 × ₱68.75) = ₱360.94
