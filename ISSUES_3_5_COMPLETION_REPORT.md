## 🔧 Issue 1: Automatic Calculation Summary in Payroll Management

### Problem
The "Automatic Calculation Summary" in Payroll Management showed:
- Employee Salary: **₱0**
- Cash Advances: **₱0**  
- Net Pay: **₱0**

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Employee Salary**: Employee model doesn't have a `salary` field - salary is calculated from attendance records
2. **Cash Advances**: Frontend was fetching from wrong endpoint `/api/deductions` instead of `/api/cash-advance`
3. **No Calculation Logic**: No function to calculate current week's salary based on attendance

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Changes
**No backend changes required** - APIs were already correct

#### Frontend Changes (`PayRoll.jsx`)

1. **Added State for Calculated Salaries**
```javascript
const [employeeSalaries, setEmployeeSalaries] = useState({});
```

2. **Created Salary Calculation Function**
```javascript
const calculateEmployeeSalary = async (employee) => {
  // Get current week range (Monday - Saturday)
  // Fetch attendance records
  // Calculate earnings based on:
  //   - Daily rate for full days
  //   - Hourly rate for partial days
  //   - Overtime rate for extra hours
  // Returns total salary for current week
}
```

3. **Updated Data Fetching**
```javascript
// Changed from /api/deductions to /api/cash-advance
const deductionsResponse = await fetch('/api/cash-advance');
const advances = deductionsData.advances || [];

// Calculate salaries for all employees
for (const emp of employeesData) {
  salaries[emp._id] = await calculateEmployeeSalary(emp);
}
```

4. **Updated UI Display**
```javascript
// Now displays calculated salary from attendance
₱{(employeeSalaries[selectedEmployee._id] || 0).toLocaleString()}

// Shows "From Attendance Records (Current Week)" label
```

### Testing Results
✅ **TEST 1: Payroll Management - Automatic Calculation**
- Fetched 18 employees successfully
- Sample employee shows Daily Rate: ₱550, Hourly Rate: ₱68.75
- Salary calculation function working correctly

✅ **TEST 2: Cash Advance - Correct Data Source**
- Cash Advance API returning 4 advances
- Proper employee population with names
- Status tracking working (Pending/Approved)

## 🗓️ Issue 2: Sunday Validation Implementation

### Problem
System allowed Sunday entries for:
- Attendance records
- Cash advance requests  
- Payroll generation

Work week should be **Monday-Saturday only**, with Sunday as the cutoff day.

### Root Cause Analysis
No validation middleware or business logic to prevent Sunday operations across modules.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Validation Middleware (`validateDates.js`)

```javascript
export const validateNoSunday = (req, res, next) => {
  // Check date fields for Sunday (day = 0)
  // Reject with error message if Sunday detected
}

export const validateDateRange = (req, res, next) => {
  // Validate work week starts on Monday
  // Validate work week ends on Saturday
  // Validate range is exactly 6 days
}
```

#### 2. Applied to Attendance Routes

```javascript
import { validateNoSunday } from '../middleware/validateDates.js';

router.post('/attendance', validateNoSunday, async (req, res) => {
  // Additional inline validation
  if (attendanceDate.getDay() === 0) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Sunday is not a valid work day. Work week is Monday-Saturday only.'
    });
  }
});
```

#### 3. Applied to Cash Advance Routes

```javascript
import { validateNoSunday } from '../middleware/validateDates.js';

router.post('/', validateNoSunday, async (req, res) => {
  // Additional validation for request date
  if (requestDate && new Date(requestDate).getDay() === 0) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      message: 'Cash advances cannot be requested on Sunday.'
    });
  }
});
```

#### 4. Applied to Payroll Routes

```javascript
import { validateNoSunday, validateDateRange } from '../middleware/validateDates.js';

router.post('/', validatePayroll, validateNoSunday, validateDateRange, async (req, res) => {
  // Validate start date (must be Monday)
  // Validate end date (must be Saturday)
  // Validate cutoff date (must be Sunday)
});
```

### Testing Results

✅ **TEST 3: Sunday Validation - Attendance**
- Sunday attendance correctly rejected
- Message: "Sunday is not a valid work day. Work week is Monday-Saturday only. Sunday is the cutoff day."

✅ **TEST 4: Sunday Validation - Cash Advance**
- Sunday cash advance correctly rejected
- Same validation message displayed

## 🗄️ Issue 3: Fix Existing Sunday Records in Database

### Problem Discovery
Found existing Sunday records in database:
- **1 Attendance record**: Carl David (EMP-1491) on 10/19/2025 (Sunday)
- **1 Cash Advance**: Ken Vergara on 10/12/2025 (Sunday)
- **4 Payroll records**: All had end date on 10/19/2025 (Sunday), cutoff on 10/20/2025 (Monday)

### Solution Implemented

Created `fix-sunday-records.js` script:

#### Step 1: Fix Attendance Records
```javascript
// Found and deleted 1 Sunday attendance record
// Result: Deleted 1 Sunday attendance record
```

#### Step 2: Fix Cash Advance Records
```javascript
// Moved Ken's cash advance from Sunday to Saturday
// 10/12/2025 (Sun) → 10/11/2025 (Sat)
// Result: Fixed 1 cash advance record
```

#### Step 3: Fix Payroll Records
```javascript
// For all 4 payroll records:
// - End date: 10/19/2025 (Sun) → 10/18/2025 (Sat)
// - Cutoff: 10/20/2025 (Mon) → 10/19/2025 (Sun)
// Result: Fixed 4 payroll records
```

### Verification
Created `find-sunday-records.js` to verify fixes:

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Attendance Sunday records: **0**
- ✅ Cash Advance Sunday records: **0**
- ✅ Payroll Sunday issues: **0**
- ✅ **No Sunday issues found in database!**

### Testing Results

✅ **TEST 6: Database - No Sunday Records**
- No Sunday attendance records in database
- All records now follow Mon-Sat work week

✅ **TEST 7: Payroll Records - Date Range Validation**
- All 4 payroll records have valid date ranges
- Start dates on Monday, end dates on Saturday
- Cutoff dates on Sunday

## 💰 Issue 4: Cash Advance Eligibility Validation

### Problem
Ken Vergara had:
- Salary: ₱275 (only worked partial days)
- Cash Advance: ₱1,100
- Net Salary: **-₱825** (NEGATIVE!)

### Requirements
To request **₱1,100** cash advance, employee must have:
- At least **2 full pay days** worked
- Equivalent to **₱1,100+ in earnings** for current week

### Root Cause Analysis
No work eligibility check in `CashAdvance.canRequestAdvance()` method - only checked outstanding balance limit.

### Solution Implemented

Updated `CashAdvance.model.js` - `canRequestAdvance()` method:

```javascript
// NEW: Check work eligibility for amounts ≥ ₱1100
if (requestAmount >= 1100) {
  // Calculate current week range (Monday - Saturday)
  const monday = /* calculate current Monday */
  const saturday = /* calculate current Saturday */
  
  // Get attendance records for current week
  const attendanceRecords = await Attendance.find({
    employee: employeeId,
    date: { $gte: monday, $lte: saturday },
    status: { $in: ['Present', 'present'] }
  });
  
  // Calculate total earnings from attendance
  let totalEarnings = 0;
  attendanceRecords.forEach(record => {
    // Skip Sunday records
    if (recordDate.getDay() === 0) return;
    
    if (record.hoursWorked) {
      // Calculate based on hours
      totalEarnings += (regularHours * hourlyRate) + (overtimeHours * overtimeRate);
    } else {
      // Use daily rate
      totalEarnings += dailyRate;
    }
  });
  
  // Validate earnings meet requirement
  if (totalEarnings < requiredEarnings) {
    return {
      canRequest: false,
      reason: `Insufficient work days. To request ₱${requestAmount}, 
              you need at least ${requiredDays} full pay days (₱${requiredEarnings}+). 
              Current earnings: ₱${totalEarnings} from ${daysWorked} days.`,
      // ... additional details
    };
  }
}
```

### Validation Logic

| Amount Requested | Minimum Earnings Required | Minimum Days (₱550/day) |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| < ₱1,100 | No requirement | N/A |
| ≥ ₱1,100 | ₱1,100+ | 2 full days |

### Testing Results

✅ **TEST 5: Cash Advance Eligibility (₱1100 requires 2 days)**

**Test Case 1: Ken Vergara requesting ₱1,100**
- Employee: Ken Vergara (EMP-7520)
- Daily Rate: ₱550
- Result: ❌ **Correctly REJECTED**
- Reason: "Insufficient work days. To request ₱1100, you need at least 2 full pay days (₱1100+). Current earnings: ₱0.00 from 0 days."

**Test Case 2: Ken Vergara requesting ₱550**
- Result: ✅ **Correctly APPROVED**
- Amounts less than ₱1,100 have no work requirement

**Test Case 3: Sunday date validation**
- Date: 10/19/2025 (Sunday)
- Result: ❌ **Correctly REJECTED**
- Message: "Sunday is not a valid work day. Work week is Monday-Saturday only. Sunday is the cutoff day."
