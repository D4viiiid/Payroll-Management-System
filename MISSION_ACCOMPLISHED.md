## ⚠️ CRITICAL NEXT STEP

### YOU MUST RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER

**Why?** The new archived payroll endpoints won't work until the server reloads the updated routes.

**How?**
1. Find the terminal running backend server
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop
3. Run: `npm run dev` or `node server.js`
4. Wait for "Server running on port 5000"
5. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Then test:**
- Navigate to Payroll Records module
- Should see 4 records WITHOUT any TypeError
- Click "View Archive" - should work (no 404)
