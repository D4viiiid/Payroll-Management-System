# 🎯 QUICK FIX SUMMARY - October 17, 2025

## ✅ FIXES COMPLETED (4 of 5)

### 1. ✅ Profile Picture Now Persists After Logout/Login
**What was broken**: Profile picture disappeared after logging out and back in  
**What's fixed**: Picture now saved properly and stays even after multiple logins  
**Test it**: Login → Upload picture → Logout → Login → Picture still there ✅

### 2. ✅ Overtime No Longer Inflates Salary
**What was broken**: Working 13+ hours gave extra pay beyond ₱550  
**What's fixed**: Full day salary always capped at ₱550 (no overtime pay for full-day rate)  
**Bonus**: System still tracks overtime hours for records  
**Note**: 12-hour auto-timeout already working (verified)

### 3. ✅ Attendance Can't Be Created Before Hire Date
**What was broken**: System allowed attendance on Oct 15 even though hire date was Oct 16  
**What's fixed**: System now blocks attendance before employee's hire date  
**Error message**: "Cannot create attendance record before hire date"

### 4. ✅ Dashboard Stats Now Accurate
**What was broken**: Showed 5 full-day when actually 2, wrong absent count  
**What's fixed**: Dashboard numbers now match attendance page exactly  
**How**: Uses actual attendance data instead of estimates

### 5. ✅ Payslip Page Layout Fixed
**What was broken**: Different sidebar/header than other admin pages  
**What's fixed**: Now uses same AdminSidebar and AdminHeader as Dashboard, Attendance, etc.  
**Result**: Consistent look across all admin pages

---

## ⚠️ NOT YET FIXED

### Salary Page Filters & Status
**Issues**:
- Today filter shows "No records" even though people worked
- Week/Month filters not defaulting to current period  
- Status shows "Regular/On-Call" instead of "half-day/full-day"

**Why not fixed**: Requires creating salary records from attendance data (complex change)  
**Recommendation**: Address in separate focused session

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST

### Test Right Away (No Restart Needed):
1. **Profile Picture Test**:
   - Login as any employee
   - Upload profile picture
   - Logout
   - Login again
   - **✅ Picture should still be there**

### After Server Restart:
1. **Stop both servers** (Ctrl+C in both terminals)

2. **Start Backend**:
   ```
   cd employee/payroll-backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Wait for: "🚀 Server is running on port 5000"

3. **Start Frontend**:
   ```
   cd employee
   npm run dev
   ```
   Wait for: "Local: http://localhost:5173/"

4. **Test Dashboard Stats**:
   - Open Dashboard
   - Note the numbers (present, full-day, absent)
   - Open Attendance → Filter "Today"
   - **✅ Numbers should match**

5. **Test Overtime Cap**:
   - Check any attendance with 10+ hours
   - Look at payroll/salary
   - **✅ Should show ₱550 (not more)**

6. **Test Payslip Layout**:
   - Go to Payroll Records
   - Click "View Payslip"
   - **✅ Should have pink sidebar like other pages**

## ❓ IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK

- Check browser console for import errors
