# üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE - Apply Fixes

## ‚ö° Step 1: Restart Backend (CRITICAL)

The backend MUST be restarted for changes to take effect:

```bash
# In your backend terminal (Ctrl+C to stop current process)
cd employee/payroll-backend
npm run dev
```

Wait for:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB Connected Successfully
‚úÖ Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

---

## ‚ö° Step 2: Test Work Hours Calculation

### Test Case 1: Short Work (Your Current Issue)
1. Check your existing record (9:06 AM - 9:09 AM)
2. Refresh Attendance Overview page
3. **Expected**: Should NOT show in Full Day count (only 3 minutes)
4. **Actual**: Currently shows Full Day (will be fixed after restart)

### Test Case 2: Real Full Day
1. Scan fingerprint at 9:30 AM (Time In)
2. Work through the day (lunch 12:00-12:59 PM)
3. Scan fingerprint at 5:00 PM or later (Time Out)
4. Check Dashboard
5. **Expected**: Should show FullDay=1 (6.5+ hours worked)

### Test Case 3: Half Day
1. Scan at 9:00 AM (Time In)
2. Scan at 2:00 PM (Time Out)
3. **Expected**: Should show HalfDay=1 (4 hours after lunch deduction)

### Test Case 4: Too Short
1. Scan at 2:00 PM (Time In)
2. Scan at 5:00 PM (Time Out)
3. **Expected**: Should NOT count (only 3 hours, minimum is 4)

---

## ‚ö° Step 3: Test Archive Functionality

### Archive Test
1. Go to Attendance Overview
2. Find any attendance record
3. Click "Archive" button
4. Confirm the action
5. **Expected**: Record disappears from main list

### Wait Test (Important!)
1. Wait 2 minutes (auto-refresh happens at 60s)
2. **Expected**: Record stays archived (doesn't reappear)
3. **Old behavior**: Record would auto-restore ‚ùå

### Restore Test
1. Click "View Archive" button
2. Find the archived record
3. Click "Restore" button
4. Confirm the action
5. **Expected**: Record returns to main list
6. Check main list - record should be there

---

## ‚ö° Step 4: Verify Database Changes

Run this command to check your current record:

```bash
node employee/payroll-backend/test-work-hours.js
```

You should see:
```
üìä Your Current Attendance Record:
  Time In:  ... 09:06:18 ...
  Time Out: ... 09:09:12 ...
  Work Hours: 0.05 hours
  Should be: Not counted
```

---

## ‚ö° Step 5: Check for Errors

### Backend Terminal
Look for:
- ‚úÖ No errors during startup
- ‚úÖ `üìä Stats: Present=X, FullDay=Y, HalfDay=Z, Absent=W`
- ‚úÖ Work hours logs when Time Out is recorded

### Frontend Console
Look for:
- ‚úÖ No HTTP 500 errors
- ‚úÖ Archive success messages
- ‚úÖ Attendance updated events

---

## üìä Expected Results Summary

### Dashboard Stats (After Restart)
- **Present**: Employees currently working (has Time In, no Time Out)
- **Full Day**: Employees who worked 6.5+ hours (excluding lunch)
- **Half Day**: Employees who worked 4-6.5 hours
- **Absent**: Employees with no attendance today

### Your Current Record (9:06-9:09 AM)
- ‚úÖ Should show in: **Nothing** (too short, < 4 hours)
- ‚ùå Currently shows: **Full Day** (bug, will be fixed)

### Archive Behavior
- ‚úÖ Archive ‚Üí Record stays archived permanently
- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh ‚Üí Doesn't restore archived records
- ‚úÖ Restore ‚Üí Only way to bring record back

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Backend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is already in use
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill the process if needed
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Try again
cd employee/payroll-backend
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Still showing Full Day for short work
- Make sure backend is restarted (changes only apply after restart)
- Check backend terminal for stats logs
- Try creating a new attendance record (old records use old calculation)

### Issue: Archive still auto-restores
- Check backend console for archive API calls
- Look for `üì¶ Archiving attendance record: ...`
- If not appearing, check frontend Network tab for failed requests

### Issue: MongoDB connection error
- Check `config.env` file exists
- Verify `MONGODB_URI` is correct
- Test connection: `node employee/payroll-backend/test-work-hours.js`
