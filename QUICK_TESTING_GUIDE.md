## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### If image slider doesn't work:
```
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify files exist: employee/src/assets/login.png, login1.png, login2.png
3. Check Login.jsx imports all 3 images
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Clear browser cache
```

### If status shows "Unknown":
```
1. Check EmployeeDashboard.jsx has transformAttendanceData function
2. Verify function calculates status from dayType/timeIn/timeOut
3. Check StatusBadge default is "Present" not "Unknown"
4. Restart backend to ensure fresh data
5. Check browser console for API errors
```

### If sidebar looks different:
```
1. Check page imports AdminSidebar and AdminHeader
2. Verify imports: import AdminSidebar from './AdminSidebar';
3. Check JSX uses: <AdminSidebar /> and <AdminHeader />
4. Remaining pages need update: Employee, Salary, CashAdvance, PayRoll
5. Follow pattern in Dashboard_2.jsx and Attendance.jsx
```

### If modal too large:
```
1. Check AttendanceModal.jsx has maxWidth: '450px'
2. Verify maxHeight: '85vh' is set
3. Check padding is 1.25rem (not 1.5rem)
4. Font sizes should be reduced (1.4rem title, 1.75rem time)
5. Test at 100% browser zoom (not 110% or 125%)
```

### If sound doesn't play:
```
1. Check browser allows audio autoplay
2. Verify notif.mp3 exists in employee/src/assets/
3. Check AttendanceModal.jsx imports: import notifSound from '../assets/notif.mp3';
4. Verify audio element: <audio ref={audioRef} src={notifSound} preload="auto" />
5. Check console for "Error playing sound" message
6. Try clicking button (some browsers require user interaction)
```

### If 413 error appears:
```
1. Restart backend: Ctrl+C then npm start
2. Check server.js has { limit: '10mb' }
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try smaller file (2MB) first
```

### If dates show "No Date":
```
1. Check payroll has endDate field
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Create new payroll using /calculate endpoint
```

### If "Mark as Done" doesn't work:
```
1. Check browser console
2. Verify backend route exists
