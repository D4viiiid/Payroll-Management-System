## üéØ ISSUE 1: Email Service for Sending Credentials

### What Was Fixed
**ROOT CAUSE:** No automated email system existed to send employee credentials after creation.

**SOLUTION:** 
- Created `sendEmployeeCredentialsEmail()` function in `emailService.js`
- Integrated email sending in `routes/Employee.js` POST route
- HTML email template with pink gradient theme (#f06a98, #f8b6c1)
- Sends: Employee ID, Username, Plain Text Password

### Files Modified
1. `employee/payroll-backend/services/emailService.js` - Added email function (lines ~550-700)
2. `employee/payroll-backend/routes/Employee.js` - Added import and email call (lines 8, 144-168)

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Configure Email Settings
```bash
# Check .env file in payroll-backend folder
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # Gmail App Password, not regular password
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** If you don't have Gmail App Password:
1. Go to Google Account Settings
2. Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App Passwords
3. Generate new password for "Mail"
4. Use that password in .env

#### Step 2: Test Email Sending
1. **Navigate to Admin Panel** ‚Üí Employee List
2. **Click "Add Employee"** button
3. **Fill in the form:**
   - First Name: Test

   - Email: **YOUR-REAL-EMAIL@gmail.com** (use your email to receive test)
   - Employee ID: EMP999
   - Position: Tester
   - Department: IT
   - Hire Date: Today's date
   - Salary: 25000
   - Status: Active
   - Generate Username: Click button
   - Generate Password: Click button
4. **Click "Add Employee"**

#### Step 3: Verify Email Received
Check your email inbox for:
- **Subject:** "Welcome to Our Company - Your Login Credentials"

- **Contains:**
  - Pink gradient header
  - Welcome message with employee name
  - Table with Employee ID, Username, Password
  - Security notes
  - Login button linking to http://localhost:5173

#### Step 4: Verify Backend Logs
Check backend terminal for:
```
üìß Sending credentials email to: your-email@gmail.com
‚úÖ Credentials email sent successfully
```

#### Step 5: Test Login with Emailed Credentials
1. Copy username and password from email
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Select "Employee" role
4. Enter credentials from email
5. Click "Login"
6. Should successfully log in

### ‚úÖ Expected Results

## üéØ ISSUE 2: Employee Profile Data Mismatch (Status/Contact Showing Wrong Values)

### What Was Fixed
**ROOT CAUSE:** `EmployeeDashboard.jsx` line 777 used stale localStorage data that was set once during login and never refreshed from database.

**SOLUTION:** 
- Modified `fetchEmployeeData()` to fetch fresh employee data from database using `employeeApi.getById()`
- Updates localStorage with fresh data for consistency
- Falls back to localStorage if API call fails (graceful degradation)

### Files Modified
1. `employee/src/components/EmployeeDashboard.jsx` - Lines 768-840 (refetch logic)

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Create Test Employee with Known Values
1. **Admin Panel** ‚Üí Employee List ‚Üí Add Employee
2. **Fill form:**
   - First Name: Profile
   - Last Name: TestUser
   - Email: profile.test@company.com
   - Employee ID: EMP888
   - Contact Number: **09123456789**
   - Status: **Active**
   - Position: Tester
   - Department: QA
   - Hire Date: Today
   - Salary: 30000
   - Generate Username & Password
3. **Save and remember credentials**

#### Step 2: Login as Employee
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Select "Employee" role
3. Enter credentials (from email or admin panel)
4. Click "Login"

#### Step 3: Verify Initial Profile Display
In Employee Dashboard, check Profile Card:
- Status: Should show "Active" (green badge)
- Contact Number: Should show "09123456789"
- Position: "Tester"
- Department: "QA"

#### Step 4: Admin Changes Employee Data (While Employee Still Logged In)
1. **Open new browser tab/window**
2. **Login as Admin** (http://localhost:5173)
3. **Go to Employee List**
4. **Find "Profile TestUser" (EMP888)**
5. **Click Edit button**
6. **Change:**
   - Status: Active ‚Üí **Inactive**
   - Contact Number: 09123456789 ‚Üí **09987654321**
7. **Click "Update Employee"**

#### Step 5: Refresh Employee Dashboard
1. **Go back to employee's browser tab**
2. **Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)**
3. **Check Profile Card again**

### ‚úÖ Expected Results
- [x] Status changes from "Active" (green) to "Inactive" (red/gray)
- [x] Contact Number changes from "09123456789" to "09987654321"
- [x] All other profile fields remain correct
- [x] Console shows: "üîÑ Fetching fresh employee data from database"
- [x] Console shows: "‚úÖ Fresh employee data fetched"

### ‚ùå Before Fix (Bug Behavior)
Without the fix:
- Status would still show "Active" (stale localStorage)
- Contact would still show "09123456789" (stale data)
- Had to logout and login again to see changes

### üîç How to Verify Fix is Working
Check browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console):
```
üîÑ Fetching fresh employee data from database for ID: 67...
‚úÖ Fresh employee data fetched: {_id: "67...", firstName: "Profile", status: "Inactive", contactNumber: "09987654321", ...}
```

### What Was Verified
**VERIFICATION RESULTS:** Change password functionality is **FULLY WORKING** and secure:
- ‚úÖ Frontend validates password requirements (6+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- ‚úÖ Backend verifies current password using bcrypt compare
- ‚úÖ New password is properly hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- ‚úÖ Uses `findByIdAndUpdate` with `runValidators: false` to bypass pre-save hook
- ‚úÖ Password remains encrypted in database
- ‚úÖ Admin CANNOT see plain text password after change

### Files Verified
1. `employee/src/components/ChangePassword.jsx` - Frontend validation & UI
