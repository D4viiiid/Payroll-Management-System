# Biometric Time In/Out GUI Implementation Plan

## Current Status: In Progress

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Analyze existing codebase and create implementation plan
- [x] Get user approval for plan

### Pending Tasks:
- [ ] Create attendance_gui.py - dedicated time clock GUI for attendance scanning
- [ ] Modify routes/attendance.js - add automatic deduction creation logic for Half Day and absences
- [ ] Modify models/Deduction.model.js - ensure proper schema for attendance-based deductions
- [ ] Modify routes/deduction.js - add endpoint for creating attendance deductions
- [ ] Test fingerprint scanning integration with /api/attendance/record endpoint
- [ ] Implement real-time frontend updates via EventBus
- [ ] Handle error cases (unrecognized fingerprints, duplicate scans)
- [ ] Test with real ZKTeco device
- [ ] Verify frontend real-time updates work correctly
- [ ] Test deduction calculations and Half Day logic

### Key Features to Implement:
1. **Time Clock GUI**: Separate from registration, focused on attendance scanning
2. **Half Day Detection**: Automatic detection when Time In > 9:30 AM
3. **Salary Deductions**: 50% deduction for Half Day, full day for absences
4. **Real-time Updates**: Frontend Attendance and Employee pages update automatically
5. **Error Handling**: Proper handling of unrecognized fingerprints and duplicate scans

### Technical Details:
- GUI will use Tkinter with pyzkfp library for ZKTeco device communication
- Backend integration via existing /api/attendance/record endpoint
- Deductions automatically created based on attendance status
- EventBus notifications for real-time frontend updates
