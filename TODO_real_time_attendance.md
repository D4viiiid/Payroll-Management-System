# Real-Time Biometric Attendance Implementation

## Backend Changes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Install WebSocket dependencies (`ws` library)
- [x] Add WebSocket server setup in `server.js`
- [x] Modify `/api/attendance/record` endpoint to emit real-time events

## Frontend Changes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add WebSocket client connection in `apiService_updated.js`
- [x] Handle real-time attendance events in frontend components

## Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test WebSocket connection establishment
- [x] Test real-time attendance updates from GUI scan
- [x] Verify complete biometric flow: GUI → Backend → Frontend update

## Current Status
- Python GUI exists and connects to ZKTeco device
- Backend has attendance recording endpoint with WebSocket broadcasting
- Frontend has WebSocket client and event listeners
- Ready for testing the complete flow
