DEPLOYMENT_REASON=Force complete frontend rebuild - Salary.jsx dayType fixes not deploying
FORCE_REBUILD=true

This file forces Vercel to rebuild the entire frontend.
DO NOT DELETE - used for deployment tracking.

CRITICAL FIXES IN THIS DEPLOYMENT:
1. Salary.jsx - Line 737-765: Check dayType instead of status (sync)
2. Salary.jsx - Line 643-674: Check dayType with validation (manual creation)
3. Both include legacy record support (calculate dayType from work hours)
