# Debug Plan: Backend, Python GUI, and Attendance Page Integration

## Issues Identified

### 1. Backend Issues
- ✅ WebSocket server running on port 8081, but frontend expects 8080
- ✅ MongoDB connection may fail silently
- ✅ Attendance recording endpoint exists but may have validation issues
- ✅ WebSocket broadcasting may not be working

### 2. Python GUI Issues
- ✅ Backend URL hardcoded to localhost:5000 (may not be running)
- ✅ Fingerprint template encoding/decoding issues
- ✅ No proper error handling for backend communication failures
- ✅ GUI may not be sending data in correct format

### 3. Frontend Issues
- ✅ WebSocket connection URL mismatch (8080 vs 8081)
- ✅ Event listeners may not be properly configured
- ✅ Real-time attendance updates not working
- ✅ API calls may be failing silently

### 4. Integration Issues
- ✅ End-to-end data flow broken at multiple points
- ✅ No proper logging/tracing for debugging
- ✅ Database updates not reflected in real-time

## Debug Steps Completed

### Backend Verification
- [x] Check /api/attendance/record endpoint
- [x] Verify MongoDB connection
- [x] Confirm WebSocket server on port 8081
- [x] Test attendance recording independently

### Python GUI Verification
- [x] Confirm backend URL configuration
- [x] Check device connection logic
- [x] Verify POST request format to backend
- [x] Test fingerprint template encoding

### Frontend Verification
- [x] Fix WebSocket URL to match backend (8081)
- [x] Verify event listeners for attendance updates
- [x] Test direct API calls to /api/attendance
- [x] Check real-time update mechanisms

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend Fixes
- [x] Fixed WebSocket port consistency (changed frontend to use 8081)
- [x] Added better error logging in attendance routes
- [x] Improved MongoDB connection error handling
- [x] Enhanced WebSocket broadcasting with proper event types

### 2. Python GUI Fixes
- [x] Added backend connectivity check on startup
- [x] Improved error handling for network requests
- [x] Fixed fingerprint template encoding (base64)
- [x] Added proper timeout handling

### 3. Frontend Fixes
- [x] Updated WebSocket URL to ws://localhost:8081
- [x] Fixed event listener setup for real-time updates
- [x] Added proper error handling for WebSocket connections
- [x] Improved attendance data fetching and display

### 4. Integration Fixes
- [x] Ensured consistent data formats across all components
- [x] Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- [x] Implemented proper error propagation
- [x] Added test endpoints for verification

## Testing Results

### End-to-End Test Flow
- [x] Scan fingerprint in GUI → Backend receives data ✅
- [x] Backend processes and stores in database ✅
- [x] WebSocket broadcasts attendance update ✅
- [x] Frontend receives and displays update ✅

## Remaining Issues (if any)
- [ ] Test with actual ZKTeco device (currently tested with mock data)
- [ ] Verify MongoDB persistence across restarts
- [ ] Test concurrent attendance recordings
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple users

## Next Steps
1. Test with physical hardware
2. Monitor logs during actual usage
3. Add monitoring/alerting for system health
4. Consider adding backup/fallback mechanisms
